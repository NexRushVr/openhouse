// SteamVR room compatibility (#82): our rooms as SteamVR universes.
//
// SteamVR keeps Room Setup (the chaperone: standing origin, play area) per universe in
// chaperone_info.vrchap, and launches Room Setup when the universe a device reports has
// none ("calibration state 201"). Our own rooms' universes ("room-<unix time>") existed
// only in our room map, never in lighthousedb.json, and SteamVR asked for Room Setup on
// every start, even with the user's old SteamVR room set up for the same base stations.
//
// So, by default under SteamVR:
//  - a room that shares a base station with a SteamVR universe that has Room Setup done
//    (in chaperone_info.vrchap) uses that universe: its ID and its frame (RawAlignment),
//    and the old Room Setup keeps working;
//  - any other room of ours is written into lighthousedb.json as a universe of its own,
//    its bases in the host frame we report, so a Room Setup done on it has a universe
//    to belong to, and tools reading lighthousedb.json see where the bases are.
// Universes we write carry "openhouse": true: they're our rooms, never imported back as
// SteamVR's, and the only ones we ever rewrite. SteamVR's own universes are never changed.
