// Not stock: which light mode a device should be in, in a room with both kinds of base station
// (ai/driver/mixed_stations.md).
//
// In LH1 mode a device reports hits from both kinds, and PulseSorter tells them apart, but only
// for 2.0 rotors it has heard real beam words from. Those come only in LH2 mode, where a 1.0
// station gives nothing. So a device starts in LH2 mode, moves to LH1 mode once it knows the
// rotors it can see, and comes back now and then. Going to LH2 mode costs about half a second
// without light, so routine visits wait for a calm moment, and the same half second is no loss
// to a device that has lost tracking, which LH2 mode handles better on hard swings.
//
// A device can stay in LH2 mode throughout, by kind (MixedLightOptions, from the SteamVR
// settings page). The headset always does.
//
// A first-generation device (the original Vive headset, Vive wands, the 2017 Vive Tracker) has no
// LH2 mode and sees only 1.0 stations, so none of this is for it. It doesn't say so, but it gives
// itself away: told to go to LH2 mode it keeps sending LH1 pulses and never a beam word, where a
// device that can stops within about 30 ms. Then it's left out (LooksLh1Only).
//
// Live only: a replay's modes are in its recording.
